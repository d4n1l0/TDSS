== Background story ==
The Earth is invaded by a fleet of alliens called
"The Doomocrates" led by a mysterious entity of
pure evil, the Mandic. Mankind has invested all of 
its resources that were spared by global economic 
crisis into building a single powerfull spaceship.
It is your duty, as the ship's pilot to battle
your way trough the Doomocrate horde and defeat
the evil Mandic.

-How ship works-
When told to move in certain direction, the 
ship will accelerate in that direction. It 
doesn't turn instantly, and will instead make
turns with elliptical trajectory. The ship has
set ammo capacity and will produce a new missile
every few seconds. When it fires, it will launch
one of its missiles. The fire rate is not limited,
but the ship can't fire if it is out of ammo.
When hit, the ship loses a life. It starts with
3 lives and if you lose all lives, you lose the game.
You regain a life each time you get an upgrade.
-Upgrades-
Every fifth level, the player can chose an upgrade.
Fragmentation will cause each missile to send fragments
in random directions upon impact. At sufficient level, 
these fragments will also make fragments of their own.
Amount of fragments increases with upgrade level.
All fragments and the main missile deal the same damage.
The level of fragmentation upgrade alo dictates the damage
caused by missiles. At level 0, ship's damage is 1, and it
increases by 1 for each level of fragmentation.
Shield protects ship from harm. When hit, if ship has its shield,
then shield will take damage instead of ship losing a life. However,
fighters that ram the ship while it has a shield will bounce of
unharmed instead of being destroyed, while it still causes damage.
Shield regenerates over time. With each level, the number of hits shield
can take is increased by 3. It's recharge speed is increased 
proportionally.
Nuke is a slow reloading area-of-effect weapon. When activated, it
creates an explosion that expands over time, causing damage over time
to all enemies within it. The size of the explosion is proportional to
the nuke level.
--Enemies--
Every 15 seconds, a new wave of enemies appears.
Each wave is stronger than the last one. 
-Fighter-
Fighter is the most common enemy. It will fly
towards the player's ship and try to ram it,
destroying itself in the process.
It is destroyed by a single hit, but is small
and fast, making it hard to hit.
-Testudon-
A heavy battleship. Does not appear before the
third level. It is protected by a powerfull shield
at all times, except when shooting, making it very
hard to kill. It will slowly move towards the player
and when it gets close enough it will fire its triple
spread cannon. This is the only situation when it is
vulnerable. Testudon has 5 hitpoints. Additionally,
when killed, testudon produces an explosion capable of
destroying nearby fighters. A fighter will also be 
destroyed if it colides with testudon.
-Mandic-
A final boss that appears on level 15. 
It has 125 hitpoints and its attacks'
power depends on how badly damaged he is. Mandic will
fly around the upper part of the screen. alternating between
fire breath, eye laser and calling reinforcements.
Fire breath will launch a massive spread of missiles roughly
in the player's direction. Eye lasers are continuous streams
of missiles that lead their target (the player), making
them very hard to dodge. Their density makes it likely
that the player will not survive being hit by one.
When calling reinforcements, Mandic will call 1-5 fighters
to attack the player.
